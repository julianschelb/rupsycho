    "Welcome to the introductory guide for the RUPsycho Python package. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RUPsycho, a new and innovative software tool developed for the application of large language models (LLMs) in social science research. The RUPsycho package is designed to facilitate the exploration of humanlike behaviors through LLMs, offering a unique perspective in the field of natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the various components and functionalities of RUPsycho. You will learn how to set up the package, navigate its testing environments, and effectively utilize its features for analyzing LLMs in the context of social science. The guide aims to equip researchers with the knowledge and skills required to leverage RUPsycho in their studies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between artificial intelligence and human psychology."
